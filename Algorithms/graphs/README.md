# DataStructures_&_Algorithms
## Algorithms:

> * **An algorithm** is a step by step procedure to solving any given problem.
Here we take an excursion through some of the classical computer-science algorithms and the commonly used ones presently.

> * **Graphs**: A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting nodes/vertices and edges. It can be used to represent connections between objects.
